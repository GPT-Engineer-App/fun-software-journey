# fun-software-journey

Make a simple website that has "Blixt" (my name) in white on top of a blue background. It should fade in and move up into place as the page loads in. Under this title it should have a subtitle: "Making software more fun" and under that, the text: "Iâ€™m currently exploring ways to make interacting with computers more fun, with a little help from AI."
